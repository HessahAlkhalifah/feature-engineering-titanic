# Titanic Survival Prediction — Feature Engineering Pipeline

## Objective
Predict passenger survival using machine learning and engineered features.

## Techniques Used
- One-hot encoding
- Feature scaling
- Binning (Age groups)
- Log transformation (Fare)
- Interaction feature (Pclass × Fare)
- Sklearn pipeline

## Models
- Baseline Logistic Regression
- Enhanced Logistic Regression

## Result
Feature engineering improved prediction accuracy by capturing social and economic patterns in the dataset.
